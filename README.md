# Preamble

You're looking at our take on the employee handbook. It's less of a book and more of a pamphlet, or a coffee-table guide (in that, you'll read this as much as said guide). This handbook lays out our values, guiding principles, policies, and allows us to clarify who we are as a company. It aims to be a factual, real-life view of what Altair **is** (not an idealistic or unrealistic notion of what Altair could be) in an easily editable, open-source format.

[Please do help keep this up to date!](https://github.com/altair-tv/handbook) This is a work-in-progress that'll get better with more time. Let's keep it honest. If you're just joining the team, we'll be looking to you. Change is notoriously hard, and while we work with the best of intentions for you, our creators, and their communities, the more long-toothed amongst us may miss the broken pieces left in our wake. Question things with that amazing mind of yours.

Welcome to Altair! We're ecstatic to have you with us.

â€” [Bryan](https://twitter.com/avalonstar), CEO
