# Benefits & Perks

## Paid Time Off

We want you to take the time you need to relax and recharge, to train, and to game. While many startups offer a very simple "unlimited vacation" policy, we believe this to be a fallacy. Many of us have encountered this first hand, if you're given unlimited paid time off, you don't _actually take any_ time off. 

Instead, we set a minimum expected vacation or "passion time off". Our expectation is that everyone (including founders and early hires) will take **a minimum of 1 week of vacation per year**. If you have taken less than one week of vacation in a calendar year, expect us to talk to you about it.

We also embrace a more nuanced view of time off. We want your time off to be _quality_ time off, and to have the freedom to mix work and free time in different ways.

* Take occasional 3-day weekends.
* Travel while still working about half time (a “workcation”).
* Relax at home and enjoy a newly released game (a “staycation”).
* Go away on a longer (week+) vacation where you fully disconnect from work.

Can you truly take unlimited vacation? Of course not. You can't expect to take 6 months of paid vacation per year. But, there is also not a hard limit on the number of days off per year that you can take. Between longer vacations and random days off here and there, a typical employee should take enough time off that they are able to sustainably perform their job function at a high level.

Seek approval if you plan to take more than 2 weeks time off. If that allotment is greater than 4 weeks, talk to your manager, or Bryan, to review the request, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis.

### Company Observances

Altair observes all [US federal holidays](https://www.federalpay.org/holidays), [Juneteenth](https://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm), and [Indigenous Peoples Day](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/national-museum-american-indian/2019/10/11/indigenous-peoples-day-2019/) as paid holidays.

## Sick Days

We don’t track sick days. If you’re under the weather, take the time you need to feel better within reason. Altair recognizes, too, that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Consider taking a mental health day every now and again when you’re feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued.
